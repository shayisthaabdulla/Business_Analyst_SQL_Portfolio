# 📘 SQL Portfolio for Business Analysts

## 👩‍💻 About This Repository

Welcome to my **SQL Portfolio**, where I’ve recreated real-world Business Analyst use cases through structured queries, sample datasets, and scenario-based analysis using PostgreSQL.

Each project in this portfolio reflects the kind of data validation, reporting, and process optimization work I’ve done in actual enterprise settings — including CRM workflows, content operations, marketing automation, and business intelligence.

All queries use **PostgreSQL** and are beginner to intermediate-friendly.
